## Introduction to Application

**Swear Counter** is a mobile app developed using Flutter and designed within the theme of Connected Environments. The application tracks and manages users' swearing habits by integrating Firebase and speech-to-text functionality alongside a Large Language Model (LLM) for contextual analysis. 

The app features four main sections:
- **Home Page:** Displays the user's total swear count.
- **History Page:** Shows statistical trends of swearing over time.
- **Friends Page:** Allows users to add friends, view rankings, and compare stats socially.
- **Settings Page:** Provides customization, user profile management, and debug tools.

Firebase services are utilized for authentication, database storage, and profile image uploads. The app supports both Google Sign-In and email authentication. It emphasizes gamification and habit awareness, leveraging real-time feedback, intuitive UI design, and social features to promote positive behavioral change.

The app was tested across platforms and has been developed iteratively with a clear GitHub commit history, user feedback integration, and real-time database syncing.
